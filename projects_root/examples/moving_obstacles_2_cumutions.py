ENABLE_GPU_DYNAMICS = True # # GPU DYNAMICS - OPTIONAL (originally was disabled)# GPU Dynamics: Enabling GPU dynamics can potentially speed up the simulation by offloading the physics calculations to the GPU. However, this will only be beneficial if your GPU is powerful enough and not already fully utilized by other tasks. If enabling GPU dynamics slows down the simulation, it may be that your GPU is not able to handle the additional load. You can enable or disable GPU dynamics in your script using the world.set_gpu_dynamics_enabled(enabled) function, where enabled is a boolean value indicating whether GPU dynamics should be enabled.# See: https://docs-prod.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/reference_material/speedup_cheat_sheet.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com # See: https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/reference_material/sim_performance_optimization_handbook.html
