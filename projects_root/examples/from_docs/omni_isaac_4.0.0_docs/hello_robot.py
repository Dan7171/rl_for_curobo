    # In Omniverse Isaac Sim, Robots are constructed of physically accurate articulated joints.
    # Applying actions to these articulations make them move.
    # Next, apply random velocities to the Jetbot articulation controller to get it moving.
    # Every articulation controller has apply_action method
    # which takes in ArticulationAction with joint_positions, joint_efforts and joint_velocities
    # as optional args. It accepts numpy arrays of floats OR lists of floats and None
    # None means that nothing is applied to this dof index in this step
    # ALTERNATIVELY, same method is called from self._jetbot.apply_action(...)

    # Both next 2 forms are ok. 
    # This is the more general but less simple form:    
    # jetbot_robot.get_articulation_controller().apply_action(ArticulationAction(joint_positions=None,

    # This is the simpler form for wheeled robots:
    # Omniverse Isaac Sim also has robot-specific extensions that provide further customized functions and access to other controllers and tasks (more on this later). Now youâ€™ll re-write the previous code using the WheeledRobot class to make it simpler.
