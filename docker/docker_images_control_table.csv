2. In host: run curobo/docker/start_docker_isaac_sim45root.sh in terminal. BUT: Make sure you change the tag to ‘latest’ (row 28. At this point it gets only names, in future I’ll add support in tag ids, sorry). 
","This is the first image I built.

# IMAGE INSPIRED BY:
That image is inspired and based by curobo’s docker scripts.
Built based on the original curobo’s docker image building script:
Build steps and logic:
- First, I read curobo original dockerfile curobo/docker/isaac_sim.dockerfile. 
Using curobo/docker/build_docker.sh one can built it easily.

*Contents (of original curobo’s isaac sim image)*:

Isaac sim: V (support a few version, all =< 4.0.0)

Ros2: X

Isaac Ros workspaces: X

Curobo: V (installed on omni_python)

Access to our repo (rl for curobo): X

Curobo with depth camera and nvblox support: V (installed on omni_python-isaac sim python interpreter)

OS: probably ubuntu 20.04 (based on curobo website and the different process of installing vulkan that they used (which is not needed at 22.04, see the (new)image process below)

Python interpreter to run curobo examples with: Isaac sim’s python interpreter (omni_python): ? (probably3.10 or below)



# NEW IMAGE BUILDING
Then inspired by curobo’s image exaplained above,  I built the image using: a custom new script curobo/docker/isaac_sim_45.dockerfile. If you want to re-build just run it as is (no build_docker.sh  script is needed as in curobo’s image…)


*Contents (of new (this) image)*:

Isaac-sim:V 4.5.0 

Ros2: V (Used humble, supported on ubuntu 22.04, matching isaac sim 4.5.0 according to isaacsim docs, py3.10 (in internal ros interpreter, but its the same version of )I picked hubmle for two reasons: its the reccomended for isaac sim 4.5.0 and it has the same python version (3.10) as  isaac sim 4.5 has)

Curobo: V (installed on omni_python (just as in the original curobo image)

Isaac Ros workspaces: V (TODO: Need to describe here when I get a chance to play with them)

OS: Ubuntu22.04 (changed from 20.04 of curobo original build, explain some changes in the docker build script (read its comments))
Isaac sim’s python interpreted (omni_python): 3.10

Copied rl_for_curobo from host to /workspace/rl_for_curobo in image
Then installed the packages rl_for_curobo and curobo (the one inside rl_for_curobo, not the one under /pkgs/curobo (original installation) using omni_python -m pip -e (editable mode)
Then saved. Dockerfile available in curobo/docker/isaac_sim_45v2.dockerfile
Build requires running:
“ cd rl_for_curobo && docker build -t curobo_isaac45v2 -f curobo/docker/isaac_sim_45v2.dockerfile . “  (this pulls the base image, but read this .dockerfile if you want instructions for how to not pull the base but re-build it and then build this (v2) image).
After installing curobo and rl_for_curobo packages, sets the current directory to /workspace/rl_for_curobo (so everytime we run the container it goes there)
Running script is available in curobo/docker/start_docker_isaac_sim45rootv2.sh
