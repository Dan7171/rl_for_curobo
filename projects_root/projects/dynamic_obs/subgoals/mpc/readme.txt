Let me explain the key components of the solution I've created:
RL Algorithm (rl_algs_api.py):
Implemented an Actor-Critic architecture with Gaussian policy for continuous action space
Uses Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) for more stable training
Supports both stochastic and deterministic action selection
Includes gradient clipping and advantage normalization for stability
RL Agent (rl.py):
Handles state representation combining:
Robot state (joint positions, velocities, accelerations, jerks)
Original goal pose
Current goal pose (RL action)
World state (either precise object info or depth camera data)
Implements reward function considering:
Collision penalty using CuRobo's collision checker
Goal achievement reward
Time penalty to encourage efficiency
Distance-based reward for progress
Training Script (train.py):
Sets up Isaac Sim environment with dynamic obstacles
Integrates MPC with RL agent
Handles episode loops, data collection, and agent updates
Includes evaluation and model saving
Supports both debug mode (precise object info) and real-world mode (depth camera)
The workflow is:
RL agent observes current state (robot + environment)
RL agent selects a new goal pose as its action
MPC plans trajectory to reach this intermediate goal
Environment steps forward, obstacles move
Process repeats until goal reached or episode ends
RL agent is updated with collected experience
Some notes about the implementation:
State Representation:
Robot state includes full joint information (28D for 7 joints Ã— 4 features)
Goal poses use position + quaternion representation (7D each)
World state is flexible:
Debug mode: Precise object poses and properties
Real mode: Processed depth camera features
Reward Design:
Heavily penalizes collisions using CuRobo's collision checker
Rewards goal progress through distance reduction
Includes time penalty to encourage efficiency
Large reward for successful goal achievement
Integration with MPC:
RL agent acts as a high-level planner
MPC handles low-level trajectory optimization
Both systems share collision checking through CuRobo
Training Process:
Episodic training with moving obstacles
Periodic evaluation and model saving
Configurable parameters for obstacles, workspace, etc.
To use this system:
First install required dependencies:
Run training:
The code has some linter errors mainly due to missing Isaac Sim imports and some API mismatches. These would need to be fixed based on the exact versions of Isaac Sim and CuRobo being used. The core logic and architecture should work once these are resolved.
Would you like me to:
Fix the linter errors in the existing files
Add more functionality to any component
Explain any part in more detail?
